// Under the hood, a global object, global context is always created.

// *[
//     Shortest JS code ==> Empty JS file
// ]

// On global level, this === window

// Global Space : Anything that is not declared inside a function exists in gloobal space.

// The variables/functions that exist in the global space can be accessed in window object.

// 'this' keyword is used to get property values in its particular context.




// UNDEFINED V/S NOT-DEFINED

// 1. Undefined : It is used by JS to allocate memory to a variable.

// 2. Not defined : It is an error that shows up when we try to access a variable
// that has not been declared.

// ** Never assign undefined to a variable like a = undefined. It is a bad practice
// as it may lead to inconsistencies.
