// Scope

// Scope is referred to as the space in which a variable or function is accessible.
// Scope is directly dependent upon the lexical environment.

// Lexical : In hierarchy, it means where the code is present physically.
// Lexical Environment : Local memory along with lexical environment of the parent.

// For Example, a function's Execution Context will contain local memory & lexical environment 
// of its parent (Global Execution Context).

// For Global Execution Context, the lexical environment of its parent is null.


// SCOPE CHAIN

// The sequence of looking for a variable in an Execution Context, if not available, in its
// parent's lexical environment is referred to as scope chain.
